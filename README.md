This is an excercise for my game technollogy class at Indiana University
where we were experimenting with particle effects in python arcade.

I decided to try and make fire particle effects. I started with a bllue color 
and then had the collor change to white, yellow, then dark orange and red to 
emulate a flame. The picture I used for the particles was actually a picture of dirt.
